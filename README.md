Gridicons
=========

An experiment to collaboratively create a new consistent icon set. 

### Icon Guidelines

- 24dp base grid
- straight 45 degree angles
- flat, bidimensional look (no faux 3D whatsoever)
- 2dp lines
- 2dp radius rounded corners only when necessary
- no logos
- hollow means inactive, solid means active (for example a hollow bookmark star is solid when checked)

These are not rules, they are guidelines that can be broken in style. The purpose of them is to try an ensure a uniform look as we all work on it together. They are also open to growing organically.

### Making a new icon

Make sure your repo is fresh, then open all-icons.ai. Press Shift + O to open the Artboard manager. Now create a new artboard and position it where it makes sense. Then draw your icon. 

### Exporting

To export SVGs, in Illustrator pick "Save as copy", pick the SVG format, and check "artboards".

### Icon Font

For now there's a basic FontCustom template system bundled with this package. This will probably be a temporary thing to transition away from, and towards inline SVGs.
