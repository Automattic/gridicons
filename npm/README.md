In this Readme file you will learn about the contents of the npm folder and how the gridicons npm package is generated, tested and published to npm.

# npm
The npm package generation has three folders:
- npm/generate
- npm/publish
- npm/test

**npm/generate**
This contains files that are used by grunt in order to generate the `publish\index.js` module that is to be published to npm. In addition a `test/index.js` is also generated in order to test the index.js module that has been generated before pulishing it to npm.

**npm/publish**
The publish folder holds the contents that gets published to npm and will be made available under the `node_modules` folder in any project that installs the gridicons package using `npm install gridicons`. Any content highlighted by the `.npmignore` file will not be published to npm.

**npm/test**
This folder contains files that will be used for testing the `publish\index.js` module. It contains two files:
1. index.html
 This is a client-side html page that displays the various gridicons to ensure they look good before pulishing to npm.
2. bundle.js
 This is a file generated by [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) so that any nodejs based package dependencies of the `gridicons` module can be included into index.html on the client side browser for testing.
3. Testing.md
 This file documents the steps required in order to perform the testing and validation before publishing the `gridicons` npm package.

# node_modules
Lastly, besides the npm folder, there is also a `node_modules` folder that contains any external dependencies that are `require`'d by `gridicons`.
